# GiveAHandToGetAWord
Give a Hand to Get a Word is a program that I designed using Python and OpenCV that translates the deaf hand signs to letters using a geometrical approach. The current version of the program isn't 100% functional due to the deadline of the exam but I'm still willing to work on it as a personal project in the coming days.
